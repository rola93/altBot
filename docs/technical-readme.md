# altBot
[@AltBotUY](https://twitter.com/AltBotUY) is a twitter bot to promote the usage of alt_text to describe images in Twitter.

[Alternative text (alt_text)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Accessibility/Alternative_text_for_images)
 is text associated with an image that serves the same purpose and conveys the same essential information as 
 the image. In situations where the image is not available to the reader, perhaps because they have turned off 
 images in their web browser or are using a screen reader due to a visual impairment, the alternative text ensures 
 that no information or functionality is lost. 
 
 [Here](https://www.lacunavoices.com/explore-world-with-lacuna-voices/being-blind-in-digital-world-social-media-inernet-accessibility) you can find an article from [@mili_costabel](https://twitter.com/mili_costabel) that perfectly describes how important are those alt_texts. 

# Logic

Currently, the logic goes like follows:

 * Some Twitter accounts are followed by the bot (friends) and some tweeter users follow the bot (followers). 
 * Periodically, the bot checks for new tweets from both, friends or followers, and checks its last tweets 
 for images with alt_text
     * if the tweet doesn't contain images, nothing is done
     * if the tweet contains images, and for all of them an alt_text is given, then it is faved
     * if the tweet contains images without any alt_text, then it depends if it is a Follower or a Friend:
     
        * Friends: the tweet is responded with another tweet with the following text:
       _驕뢢잺 Este tweet ser칤a m치s inclusivo con el uso de textos alternativos (alt_text) para 
       describir  todas sus im치genes... Este art칤culo te podr칤a ayudar: 
       https://help.twitter.com/es/using-twitter/picture-descriptions_, defined in `bot_messages.AUTO_REPLY_NO_ALT_TEXT`
        * Followers: the tweet is replied with a direct message if possible: 
     _Este tweet ser칤a m치s inclusivo con el uso de textos alternativos (alt_text) para describir todas sus im치genes...
      <link-to-tweet>. Este art칤culo podr칤a ayudar: https://help.twitter.com/es/using-twitter/picture-descriptions\n 
      Gracias por seguirme!_, defined in `bot_messages.AUTO_DM_NO_ALT_TEXT`
        * Followers, **without DMs**: the tweet is responded with another tweet since DMs are unavailable, 
        with a different text: _驕뢢잺 Este tweet ser칤a m치s inclusivo con el uso de textos alternativos (alt_text) para 
        describir todas sus im치genes... Este art칤culo podr칤a ayudar: 
        https://help.twitter.com/es/using-twitter/picture-descriptions\n Gracias por seguirme! Mandame DM para 
        recordarte por ah칤 a futuro 游땔_, defined in `bot_messages.AUTO_REPLY_NO_DM_NO_ALT_TEXT`.
        
    
A Follower is any user that follows the bot [@AltBotUY](https://twitter.com/AltBotUY), a friend is any user followed 
by the bot. If a user is both friend and follower, it is processed as follower.
                        
     
`altBot_main.py` module contains all logic to run this, all you need is to implement a main function
to run all this, then its execution must be someway chroned, for instance with chron or chrontab in linux. 

You need also to supply your tweeter credentials in `settings` module, read 
[here](https://realpython.com/twitter-bot-python-tweepy/#creating-twitter-api-authentication-credentials) how
to do it.

# Change log
This section summarizes the differences and improvements from version to version. Notice that not all of them are 
currently in production (prod branch). Some of them are closed issues in master, waiting to be released

## V1.0.
[prod] Initial version: check for some hardcoded accounts only and reply them publicly if alt_text is not used.

## V1.1
[prod] Those changes are not in production yet. A database is first needed to make it robust enough.
 *  Usage of alt_text is now checked for both: followers and friends. Friends are reply publicly while for followers a 
 DM is sent if possible, otherwise a public tweet inviting them to DM the bot
 * Current version add timestamp to log file
 * Messages are now defined in `bot_messages.py` module, and include a link to a tutorial on how to add alt_text 
 to images.  
 
 ## V1.2
[prod] Those changes are to put into production next Monday 19th April, after notifying followers with a DM on changes.
 * Add a SQLITE database to save processed tweets, followers and friends, making the bot far more efficient  
 * Follow users with private content when tweets can not be read
 * Send DM to maintainer in case of unexpected error
 * Include arg parse to run the bot easier with different use cases
 * Implement broadcast message to followers to share news on the bot
 
 ## V2.0
[master] This version implies some changes in the bot usage, since the use cases implemented up to the moment did not 
fit tweeter policies with respect to [automated messages](https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-automation).
In particular, the bot can not reply to tweets of arbitrary users and only can contact users who doesn't previously
accept to be contacted. The same is true for DMs, and following the bot is not enough. Also, the followers need a clear
mechanism to opt-out. So, the use case to watch for friends accounts will be disabled and substituted with the
process mentions. DMs are still available, but now followers need to explicitly accept to receive DMs by retweeting a 
special tweet.  

 * Check if followers accepted to be DMed by retweeting a special tweet, configured in `settings.ACCEPT_DM_TWEET_ID`: 
 only followers who RT this tweet are DMed.
 * Add check bot mentions use case, with two variants:
    * Original tweets mentioning the bot and up to 3 (`setting.MAX_MENTIONS_TO_PROCESS`) arbitrary accounts the user 
    chooses. This user does not need to be friend nor follower. The bot reply to this tweet with a small report
    with the percentage of images containing alt_text for each account. If the account was never processed, then process 
    it to read some of its tweets. Only accounts must be mentioned in addition to the bot. If more than 3 are mentioned,
    only 3 of them are processed.
    * Tweets that mention the bot in reply to other tweet that contain the image. Then this tweet is reply with an 
    appropiated message telling if the image contains alt_texts or not.
    
# ROAD MAP (prioritized):
 * **BUGFIX**: Can not send DMs to all followers since the API start to throw error; maybe need to sleep or 
 use different messages
 * ~~**IMPROVEMENT**: Read the following list and use this instead of the `settings.ACCOUNTS_TO_CHECK`.~~
 * ~~**IMPROVEMENT**: crontab based local deploy, run it once a day~~
 * ~~**IMPROVEMENT**: Follow back followers whose tweets can't be read.~~
 * **IMPROVEMENT**: Currently, last `settings.LAST_N_TWEETS` (10) are retrieved from tweeter for the configured accounts, 
  then each of them is checked in our local database to see if it was already processed. This is inefficient. 
  We only need to retrieve new tweets since last download to avoid duplicates.
 * ~~**USE CASE**: Add logs to track alt_text usage and later analise how it evolves~~
 * ~~**IMPROVEMENT**: Include a real database to account for already processed tweets, dockerized if possible~~
 * ~~**IMPROVEMENT**: Add DataBase management module~~
 * ~~**IMPROVEMENT**: Modify loggs format to include timestamp~~
 * ~~**IMPROVEMENT**: Add argparse to give parameters easier~~
 * ~~**USE CASE**: Add a service for followers to friendly remind them by DM instead of by public tweets~~
 * ~~**IMPROVEMENT**: Web page, possibly as [github io page](https://pages.github.com/), in Spanish~~
 * **IMPROVEMENT**: Add Tweeter API management module (current is too coupled)
 * **IMPROVEMENT**: Tutorial on how to include alt_texts on images. Tweeter thread / page article, spanish
 * **IMPROVEMENT**: Importance of alt_texts on images. Tweeter thread / page article, spanish
 * **IMPROVEMENT**: Add a "terms of use" or privacy section thread/page
 * **IMPROVEMENT**: Add an about the project section thread/page
 * **IMPROVEMENT**: dockerize current solution
 * **IMPROVEMENT**: improve deploy to be available all time, remotely hosted
 * **IMPROVEMENT**: Improve the manage of tweeter credentials
 * **COMPLEMENT**: OCR module, based *probably* in tesseract, spanish output
 * **COMPLEMENT**: image captioning module, spanish output. Initially migth be based on Azure: Caption module in 
 English + translate, since spanish model is hard to obtain
 * **USE CASE**: Add a service to OCR/auto generate caption for images when invoked
 * **IMPROVEMENT**: A classifier is needed to know if OCR worth.
 * **USE CASE**: Add tesseract for OCR when alt_image is not provided, and reply with it instead of fixed message.
 * **USE CASE**: Add image captioning when alt_image is not provided, and reply with it instead of fixed message.
 * **USE CASE**: Auto generate monthly report with top 5 alt_text users

Feel free to tackle any of those or even add new ones!
 
 
# Requirements

Requirements can be installed with `pip install -r requirements.txt`, developed under python 3.7.7. 
 
Also need to provide the appropiated credentials to connect with Twitter, defined in `settings.py`. The interaction with twitter is done through tweepy API. 
[Here](https://realpython.com/twitter-bot-python-tweepy/#using-tweepy) you can find a complete tutorial on this API.

## running the bot

Information on how to run can be checked with `help` command, as follows:

```.env
$ python altBot_main.py --help 
usage: altBot_main.py [-h] [-u] [-wfr] [-wfw] [-m MESSAGE] [-l] [-p]

This script runs AltBotUY.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -u, --update-users    Update the local list of followers and friends.
  -wfr, --watch-alt-texts-friends
                        Run the watch-alt-text use case in friends.
  -wfw, --watch-alt-texts-followers
                        Run the watch-alt-text use case in followers.
  -m MESSAGE, --message MESSAGE
                        Send given message to followers. Can also be the path
                        to a text file containing the message.
  -l, --live            Actually send DMs, tweets and favs, otherwise just
                        logs it. Must use it for production.
  -p, --process-mentions
                        Process tweets where the bot is mentioned.
```

# Related work:

[@ImageAltText](https://twitter.com/ImageAltText) and [@get_altText](https://twitter.com/get_altText) are both Twitter 
bots for Image captioning: once you call them from a tweet, they answer with their best effort image caption. 
However, both of them only work in English.

[@AltTxtReminder](https://twitter.com/AltTxtReminder) is another bot which just suggest the usage of alt_text when not
 used. They also offer a service for their followers: suggest alt_text usage on DMs. Similarly, 
 [@AltTextCrew](https://twitter.com/AltTextCrew) offer a similar service, which also provides a bot to inspect external 
 links and report the usage of alt_text on those links
